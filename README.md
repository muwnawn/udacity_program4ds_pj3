### Project Title
Replace the Project Title: Explore US bikeshare data

### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does: 
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

### Files used
Include the files used:
In this project, I will uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Credits
